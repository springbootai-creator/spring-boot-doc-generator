# Demo Overview — SpringbootAI (DevJAI)

This demo repository shows the full workflow:

1) User stories (input)
2) Generated Spring Boot project from those stories (CodeGen)
3) Generated documentation + UML from the generated code (DocGen)

No real customer code or business logic is included — this is a synthetic example.
