# Spring Boot Documentation Generator (SpringbootAI / DevJAI)

Enterprise technical documentation for existing Spring Boot repositories.

SpringbootAI analyzes real Java / Spring Boot projects and automatically generates complete professional documentation:

- Architecture overview
- OpenAPI / Swagger documentation
- UML diagrams
- Security & audit documentation
- Integrations mapping
- Logging and observability
- Testing documentation
- Onboarding guides
- Traceability matrices
- Multi-format outputs (Markdown / PDF / diagrams)

All processing runs locally – your source code is never uploaded.

## What this repository is

This repository demonstrates the full workflow of the documentation product:

- Provide a Spring Boot codebase (demo project included)
- Run SpringbootAI documentation generation
- Obtain structured, enterprise-ready documentation artifacts

It is not a real product codebase.  
It contains only sample material to show how documentation is generated and delivered.

## Repository structure

- **sample-repo/** – example Spring Boot project used as documentation input
- **generated-docs/** – documentation outputs generated by SpringbootAI
  - Markdown documentation
  - PDF reports
  - UML diagrams
  - Architecture and audit artifacts
- **video/** – demo walkthrough
- **screenshots/** – visual examples of the generated results
